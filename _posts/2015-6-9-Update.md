Great news! A small EC sensor has been designed and boards have been ordered.
Hopefully they'll come in soon (although the eta is the 20th). Next up is the
design of a pH sensor. This will require a bit more "experimental" work, but the
concepts are sound and it should work out okay.

Essentially, a voltmeter will be designed. It's just a matter of finding the
correct voltage range.

The recipe database has gone up on Assembly, although there hasn't been too many
takers. I haven't tried to promote it much, which is probably why this hasn't
gone anywhere.

Work has begun on making a small DSL for noiselib. Not exactly sure the correct
approach to this, if this means using something like lex and yacc, or if there
is some other way to devise this. We'll see soon in the future.
